# Flutter DDD Firebase

This repository is a some kind of fork of the original Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course from Reso Coder, but updated to the latest versions of Dart, Flutter and other dependencies.

So if you have some problems with null safety or something else like I did, checkout this repository and I hope it will help you.
